# Off-policy Reinforcement Learning with Prompt Optimization (ORPO) Project

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Off-policy Reinforcement Learning with Prompt Optimization (ORPO) project. This project is my endeavor to explore and refine language model training using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques that integrate prompt optimization, significantly enhancing model adaptability and performance.

## Project Overview

This repository encapsulates my efforts in applying the ORPO technique to fine-tune language models. ORPO is an advanced method combining reinforcement learning with prompt-based learning, aiming to optimize large-scale models for specific tasks more efficiently than traditional methods.

## Fine-Tuning Process

### Model Selection and Configuration
- I started with selecting `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B` as the base model for fine-tuning. The model is highly regarded for its robust performance across various NLP tasks.
- Configurations for the model were set to handle 4-bit quantization using Bits and Bytes, optimizing for computational efficiency without compromising performance, especially on hardware that supports such operations.

### Tokenizer Adaptation
- A custom tokenizer setup was employed to ensure that the prompts generated during training were aligned with the input requirements of the base model.

### Efficient Training Adaptations
- I integrated Parametric Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) using the `LoraConfig` to introduce trainable parameters selectively within the model. This approach allows for maintaining a vast majority of the model's parameters frozen, reducing memory footprint and computational demand.
- `ORPOConfig` was used to meticulously set hyperparameters such as learning rate and scheduler, optimizing the training loop specifically tailored for reinforcement learning with prompts.

### Training and Evaluation
- I managed datasets by splitting them into training and testing subsets, ensuring a robust evaluation of the model's performance post-fine-tuning.
- The ORPO Trainer leveraged multi-processing to preprocess and tokenize the datasets efficiently, preparing them for training.
- Training involved a careful balance of parameters, including batch sizes and gradient accumulation steps, to maximize resource utilization and training dynamics.
- Regular evaluation checkpoints were established to monitor the model's performance and make necessary adjustments to the training regimen.

### Integration with Weights & Biases
- I utilized Weights & Biases for real-time tracking of training metrics and logging, which significantly aided in maintaining a clear oversight over the training process and outcomes.
